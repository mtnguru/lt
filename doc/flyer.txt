Features                    Based on Open Source solutions


My Objective at SciFoo

LabTime started as a platform for me to learn about IIOT, MQTT, the Historian, and the REACT JavaScript framework.  It has involved into a working solution to acquire, manage and display the information used to run a laboratory or manufacturing operation. 

LabTime uses state of the art technology to bring together all of your data into one place.  All information is available anywhere in the world through a web browser.

It currently works well to acquire data from sensors and display that data in a Grafana dashboard.  However to take it the next step and start controlling equipment it needs a lot of development.  The framework is in place and solid, but there is still much to do.

About James Sorensen

I have over 30 years experience creating software applications to acquire, save, analyze and communicate data in the semiconductor industry and in scientific laboratories.  I started developing LabTime as a platform to learn about the IIoT, MQTT, Historians and the REACT JavaScript framework.  LabTime has since evolved into a comprehensive solution to manage the data associated with running experiments or operating a production line.
 
My objective for this weekend is to accomplish any (or all :-) of the following

  - Find a laboratory or company that is looking into implementing MQTT technology and work for them as a consultant to either install LabTime or to develop a similar solution of their own.

  - Find someone experienced with Open Source software and discuss the feasibility of making LabTime into an Open Source solution.

  - Find work as a contractor designing and developing a Drupal web site for managing content or media in a laboratory or company.

Please contact me and let's meet this weekend.  I can give you a demo and explain the benefits of this system.
