Today I am writing up a list of feature of my LabTime software and decided to give ChatGPT a shot at it.  Over the last hour I've gradually entered the following statements and it came up with a pretty good start for a final document.

Add using InfluxDB and Grafana for analysis
Add that all packages are open source
Make this into a bulleted list
Add real time video streaming
Change real time to live
Add that all configuration is done with JSON files
Add that users can do real time chat and can save notes in place of using a notebook
Add that the UI is web based and can be viewed anywhere in the world
