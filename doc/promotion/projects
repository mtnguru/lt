Each Upstream production is a project
Each Labtime experiment/reactor is a project

There is one administrator per mqtt server - but this doesn't have to be
It would be nice to have multiple administrator 
   ease of editing configuration files
   test administrator
If I start the administrator with an id I can organize my config files per administrator.

When clients request config all administrators will get the request
If a client is not in the client list then notify not found - for debugging

Administrator builds the project list, client list and metric list by accessing
all files in the appropriate directory.

Each administrator can have multiple projects

Administrator needs to know the root path and adminId before it can load files

Each clients needs to know the - this can be deleted from files
The administrator is the only client that can get this from a file.
Programs running on a client with a files system can get in from the .env file.
