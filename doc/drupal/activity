   Realm
      A combination of the virtual space, real space, and equipment set necessary to instantiate a project.

Entities - by implementing entities I can use my own bundles.

I still like the idea of Realm
   A realm the virtual and real space and equipment necessary to instantiate a project
   There can be one instance per realm running at a time
   A project can have multiple instances running simultaneously if they are in differenct realms

   

Realm
   Set of equipment - chamber, arduinos, plc's, location
   Realms have to be kept isolated - through topics
