Introduction


First principles
  Duality
  The nucleus has a structure
    This structure is reflected in the layout of the Periodic Table
    A stable nucleus has a a stable structure
    The nuclear structure creates the electron "orbitals"

  The structure is determined by spherical dense packing
    Of course the nuclear structure and element properties are related
    The platonic solids - tetrahedron, icosahedron - follow the rules of dense spherical packing
    The icosahedron is the largest object possible following dense packing rules - 
    After that you start to 'grow' additional icosahedrons on two locations of the base icosahedron
