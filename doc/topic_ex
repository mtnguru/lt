All Clients
====================
On startup clients only know the MQTT server IP, name:password and possibly their mqtt client name
They connect to the MQTT server and request their configuration file.
  P a/cmd/server
      CLIENTID = Command line option | CLIENT_NAME | IP
  S a/cmd/all
  S a/cmd/CLIENTID

if CLIENTID = IP then change to CLIENT_NAME after bootstrap - why?
   
All clients can publish:
  P PROJECT/act/CLIENTID/USERID
  P PROJECT/cod/CLIENTID/USERID
  P PROJECT/msg/CLIENTID/USERID
  P a/rpt/CLIENTID  - post reports: status

player is the only client which requires a unique user id 
   email_address:random_number     Example: james@ecosleuth.com:98257
