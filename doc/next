arduino - create a subscribe function that resubscribes any time the client connects and reconnects

riolc - connect an out put to an input - first read the voltage, then output a voltage and see the changes 
- need to have a project running -

all  mqttAdminAllSub        a/cmd/all
cmd  mqttAdminCmdSub        a/cmd/IP    ->    a/cmd/CLIENTID
rsp  mqttAdminRspSub        a/rsp/IP    ->    a/rsp/CLIENTID
out  mqttOutputSub          rf/out/CLIENTID

cmd  mqttAdminCmdPub[topicSize]; a/cmd/administrator  // publish command to administrator
rsp  mqttAdminRspPub[topicSize]; a/rsp/CLIENTID       // publish responses to administrator commands
inp  mqttInputPub[topicSize];    a/cmd/administrator
cod  mqttCodPub[topicSize];      rf/inp/CLIENTID
msg  mqttMsgPub[topicSize]       rf/msg/CLIENTID

==========================


RegisterMetric CB - The type is embedded in the Influx string
Use the metric and the type - every time
Also use the projectId
Register for a projectId, sourceId, metricId - 

*Change the name source to sourceId




What now?

Get chat working - do I have the software here to do it?
Yes, I do




The rack is replaced - It makes a little too much noise - I hope it calms down.
The turn signal is drying out - can I order new ones?
So what next?   What can I work on.
It's 9:51/  Check to see if I have my bushings.
Install the new rack and pinion today?
That or what? 

Might as well, it would be a change of pace for sure.






What next?  Let's do something cool
Make the image overlay work.  Read in the file,
cycle through it.


Get chat working
   Use msg stuff created earlier
Each panel needs padding
   
Make an MqttClient - how? 


Today - work on the experiment page

  Experiment page
    Cabin image of all temperature sensors
    Chat window
    Control block
      Slider sends information to the controller
      Controller slowly changes output in increments of 1 
      Display three things - human, output, input


MQTT monitor
   Break this off as a separate program

HMI
  When changing pages -
    - subscribe and unsubscribe from topics to minimize mqtt load
    - unregister and reregister all topics

Arduino
 *Reset works
 *Input works
 *Get status working from arduino
 *Start sending mqtt cod messages from arduino
 *Try Mqtt connect multiple times 
     10 times - wait 25 milliseconds - try again = total of 250 milliseconds
  Get output working on the arduino
  Wire an arduino to connect an output back to an input
    Output a voltage and measure the input
