    Put an create a simulation function?
    Plot it on grafana - oxy

    
  Contact Slobodan and Edo

What's next?


Finish install of Oxy.
Get labtime working - 
  start telegraf sessions first


Install and get running for Oxy


Save notes and chat into grafana
   Why wasn't telegraf getting my messages
  *Add Enter key to msgPane

Getting the SAFIRE lab page near completion
  Save Msgs into Influx
    It doesn't appear to be getting any messages.
      Nothing shows up
      No messages
      log file?


Hold off on the simulator.
Instead focus on the UI slider
  For now create one for pressure and put it on the SAFIRE page
  a bunch of them for testing

  Create an alarm for pressure and temperature

  Use slider to fake the pressures and temperature

  Internal     R1_Ch_K_Internal_C    Another slide to set alarms
  External     R1_Ch_K_External_C
  Ambient      R1_Ch_K_Ambient_C

Get labtime working at the lab.
  Get atlas2 configured 1 hr


So what now?  Jesus its late.
Wait for Ben, work on telegraf

Work on telegraf loaders for Michael
Get telegraf and the historian working at the Complex.
  Install a debian computer
  Install Mosquitto
  Install Influx
    create database s1
  Install Grafana
  Install my telegraf 
    git a copy

So what next?  Let's do something cool.
Save the activities in Drupal.





What should I do today - work on drupal client
Start with entities again?
Get it working first with the content types


Fix nodejs clients so they don't get multiple ???? subscriptions?



Entities




Create a realistic :q`

Group     E1  Electroyzer 1
Component Gm  GeigerMeister
Device    N2  Node 2-13
Position  1-6 Level
Units     CPS Counts per second

Create the activity entity - you have what you need.:
activity entity - watch the videos.



Drupal - get a node
So what now?
Work on loading data into Drupal
Create the activity entity
Load messages and activities into Drupal
Display those messages on the instance page.

Query Drupal for the currently active instances for a organization
Can have more than one instance per project.
A project is a piece of hardware in an experiment.  :q



Documentation
Drupal code -
Video panel
Benefits



So what next?  I don't know.  
Work on DRupal.
Do some documentation
   Finish Metrics
   Work on Topics

Arduino
  Download FreeMemory
  Look at all the major uses and consolidate them.
    Can I optimize how the configuration is saved
    Can I save the configuration in Flash - then when it shuts off it remembers. 


Change topic to include INSTANCE
Where does instance come from?

Drupal - instigator knows the instance

User logs in with LabTime
Find out what instances are running
Needs to come from the Drupal program

For now just do instance 42

There will be one controller per instance

An instance is one
   LabTime - Reactor, Apparatus, Chamber
   Upstream - Department, Group
   Finance - Team, Individual

How does an Arduino know it processId and Instance
In Drupal users selects projectId and instance for that project

A location can run one instance at a time
Multiple instance 

             Project             Instance     Domain/Arena/Realm
LabTime      Experiment          Run          Reactor
Upstream     Meeting/Production  Event        Department/Unit
Finance      Company/Unit        Game         Team

Potential names for Instigator
   Domain
   Arena
   Realm 

Reactor 1 is running a project and an instance
Reactor 2 is running a project and a different instance
Reactor 3 is running a project and a different instance

When I start a controller it needs to know the project id and instance
   query drupal with the instigator - Reactor 1


  


Get Drupal working
projects
new entities - 
  activities, 
    start time
    end time - optional
    type - TID - activity types?
    msg
  messages
    time
    type - chat, question, poll, notes
    msg


MQTT Drupal client
  Retrieve a node by NID
  List current or active projects - where does it get this?
  Find the 2-3 character id for a project
  Save activities and messages

Show the status gets sent to the children
Manage the status array, on request just ship it
Initially initialize it in administrator
Arduino
   Make arduino code use status for some fields
      enabled
      debugLevel
      clientId
      mqttClientId
      mqttConnected
   Send rsp to all requests
Labtime
 * get enabled button working
   set buttons according to the current status
 - update buttons according to changes in status
   mqttRegisterTopicCB - (topic, {rsp: ??, cmd: ??)
Administrator
 * After connecting unsubscribe from everything
   Add mqtt connected
   Initialize status for clients
      enabled
      debug level
      sample rate
                                 




What now?
On boot, have the administrator request the status for each client
Have the administrator store the status for each client
Save the status separater from the config - that or copy the config




arduino - create a subscribe function that resubscribes any time the client connects and reconnects

rio1 - connect an out put to an input - first read the voltage, then output a voltage and see the changes 
- need to have a project running -

all  mqttAdminAllSub        a/cmd/all
cmd  mqttAdminCmdSub        a/cmd/IP    ->    a/cmd/CLIENTID
rsp  mqttAdminRspSub        a/rsp/IP    ->    a/rsp/CLIENTID
out  mqttOutputSub          rf/out/CLIENTID

cmd  mqttAdminCmdPub[topicSize]; a/cmd/administrator  // publish command to administrator
rsp  mqttAdminRspPub[topicSize]; a/rsp/CLIENTID       // publish responses to administrator commands
inp  mqttInputPub[topicSize];    a/cmd/administrator
cod  mqttCodPub[topicSize];      rf/inp/CLIENTID
msg  mqttMsgPub[topicSize]       rf/msg/CLIENTID

==========================


RegisterMetric CB - The type is embedded in the Influx string
Use the metric and the type - every time
Also use the projectId
Register for a projectId, sourceId, metricId - 

*Change the name source to sourceId




What now?

Get chat working - do I have the software here to do it?
Yes, I do




The rack is replaced - It makes a little too much noise - I hope it calms down.
The turn signal is drying out - can I order new ones?
So what next?   What can I work on.
It's 9:51/  Check to see if I have my bushings.
Install the new rack and pinion today?
That or what? 

Might as well, it would be a change of pace for sure.






What next?  Let's do something cool
Make the image overlay work.  Read in the file,
cycle through it.


Get chat working
   Use msg stuff created earlier
Each panel needs padding
   
Make an MqttClient - how? 


Today - work on the experiment page

  Experiment page
    Cabin image of all temperature sensors
    Chat window
    Control block
      Slider sends information to the controller
      Controller slowly changes output in increments of 1 
      Display three things - human, output, input


MQTT monitor
   Break this off as a separate program

HMI
  When changing pages -
    - subscribe and unsubscribe from topics to minimize mqtt load
    - unregister and reregister all topics

Arduino
 *Reset works
 *Input works
 *Get status working from arduino
 *Start sending mqtt cod messages from arduino
 *Try Mqtt connect multiple times 
     10 times - wait 25 milliseconds - try again = total of 250 milliseconds
  Get output working on the arduino
  Wire an arduino to connect an output back to an input
    Output a voltage and measure the input
