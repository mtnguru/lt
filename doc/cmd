Handling commands

Problem
  hmi sends out commands to clients
  Other hmi clients need to acknowledge the command

Solution
  Add sampling to the administrator.yml file - this is only for the initial state.
  Clients can reboot at anytime, need to recover to the same state
  
  administrator application needs to keep this state information and send it to clients
     global.aab.clients.clientId.debugLevel
     global.aab.clients.clientId.sampling
  when the administrator restarts, it needs to recover this state information
     send out requestStatus to all clients
     always update the requestStatus results to update the administrator records
     use that to update the administrator.

  HMI application needs to set enable status button accordingly
    on start up use the state coming from the administrator
    when running use the rsp message to update the buttons
    useState isn't adequate - maintain the state in the global.aaa.clients 
    state updates the page - maybe it does need to be used - yeah it does
