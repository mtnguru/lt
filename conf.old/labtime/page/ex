Pages are made from panels
   Each page limits the number of panels, this reduces the code size

Panels are made from containers and components.
Big switch statement to :q

   Subscribes to stuff ? 
      Yes MqttPanel registers for every thing
      Most panels won't, they are just place holders
 
 
Each individual component registers topics or metrics



            Container
               metric stats  
               metric slider
